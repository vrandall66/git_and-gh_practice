When I was in undergrad I went on a ten day trip to London with the Theatre Department. We went to Stonehenge, Bath, took two workshops at LAMDA, toured the Globe Theatre, saw shows at the National Theatre, went to so many museums and we toured Angels Costumiers. I would move to London in a heartbeat.
