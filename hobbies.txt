I like to go to concerts, so ten months of unemployment is going to hurt that
I like climbing, but I don't have a  membership anywhere and I've never gone climbing outside. I do have my own shoes though!
I like exploring, but I'm bad about going by myself.
All I want to do in life is travel.
I need to find cheap/free hobbies.
